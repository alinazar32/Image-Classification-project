# 📷 Image Processing Project 
This repository contains an image processing project that applies various techniques to enhance, analyze, and manipulate images. The project is implemented using Python and popular libraries such as OpenCV, PIL, and NumPy. 
# ✨ Features
- Image Filtering – Apply blurring, sharpening, and edge detection filters.
- Transformation – Resize, rotate, crop, and adjust brightness/contrast.
- Object Detection – Use contour detection and edge detection algorithms.
- Color Processing – Convert images to grayscale, apply color maps, and histogram equalization.
- Noise Reduction – Implement median and Gaussian filters to remove noise.
